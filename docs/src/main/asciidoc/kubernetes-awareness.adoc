# Kubernetes Awareness

All of the features described above will work equally well regardless of whether your application is running inside
Kubernetes or not. This is really helpful for development and troubleshooting.
From a development point of view, this is really helpful as you can start your Spring Boot application and debug one
of the modules part of this project. It is not required to deploy it in Kubernetes
as the code of the project relies on the
[Fabric8 Kubernetes Java client](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client) which is a fluent DSL able to
communicate using `http` protocol to the REST API of Kubernetes Server.

# Kubernetes Profile Autoconfiguration

When the application runs as a pod inside Kubernetes a Spring profile named `kubernetes` will automatically get activated.
This allows the developer to customize the configuration, to define beans that will be applied when the Spring Boot application is deployed
within the Kubernetes platform *(e.g. different dev and prod configuration)*.

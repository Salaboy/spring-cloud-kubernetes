# Pod Health Indicator

Spring Boot uses [HealthIndicator](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/HealthEndpoint.java) to expose info about the health of an application.
That makes it really useful for exposing health related information to the user and are also a good fit for use as [readiness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/).

The Kubernetes health indicator which is part of the core module exposes the following info:

- pod name, ip address, namespace, service account, node name and its ip address
- flag that indicates if the Spring Boot application is internal or external to Kubernetes
